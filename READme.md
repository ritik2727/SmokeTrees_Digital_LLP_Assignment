Create a backend where users can register and store their addresses. There must be two tables: User and Address. There will be too many relationships between users and addresses. We would prefer if you use a relational database to store the information but MongoDB is also acceptable. Please use 1. Node.js with JavaScript or TypeScript or 2. PHP with any framework. Any other language will not be considered. There is no need to create an authentication system for the user (Login, JWT). One simple form submission should be enough to achieve this. On submitting the form user name and address are collected. The name is stored in the user table while the address is stored in the address table. Please share the assignment in the form of a GitHub link to the repository.

Your Assignments will be graded on the following parameters:
1. Functionality: Everything is working as expected
2. Code Cleanliness: How clean your code is
3. Git Commits: Number of git commits it took and messages for each commit.
